My name is Bryn Hughes, and I teach music theory at the [University of Lethbridge](http://www.uleth.ca/finearts/music).

My research interests include music cognition, music theory pedagogy, and popular music analysis. My dissertation involved an investigation of harmonic expectation in twelve-bar blues progressions. For more information, please feel free to peruse my [CV.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3uk2-8ZOE34MUVCTXN3NkZ0eVE/view?usp=sharing)

I once aspired to be a jazz trumpeter. Right now I mostly play bad piano reductions for my students. I enjoy playing hockey. I root for the Toronto teams, which means I'm disappointed with professional sports most of the time. I have a beautiful wife Jillian, a daughter Trudy, and a son James.
